# CH341 USB I2C chip support SFP EEPROM tools<BR>(Windows WPF version)
This software is a tool that allows you to find out information about optical transceivers used in network equipment. It is possible to check the information stored in the optical transceiver without having the actual large equipment used at hand.<BR>
Even if you do not have the equipment at hand, you can examine the EEPROM information file stored in binary format. Of course, the information read from the equipment can also be stored in a file.
